      <summary>
            NavigationHelper aids in navigation between pages.  It provides commands used to 
            navigate back and forward as well as registers for standard mouse and keyboard 
            shortcuts used to go back and forward in Windows and the hardware back button in
            Windows Phone.  In addition it integrates SuspensionManger to handle process lifetime
            management and state management when navigating between pages.
            </summary>
      <example>
            To make use of NavigationHelper, follow these two steps or
            start with a BasicPage or any other Page item template other than BlankPage.
            
            1) Create an instance of the NavigationHelper somewhere such as in the 
                constructor for the page and register a callback for the LoadState and 
                SaveState events.
            <code>
                public MyPage()
                {
                    this.InitializeComponent();
                    var navigationHelper = new NavigationHelper(this);
                    this.navigationHelper.LoadState += navigationHelper_LoadState;
                    this.navigationHelper.SaveState += navigationHelper_SaveState;
                }
                
                private async void navigationHelper_LoadState(object sender, LoadStateEventArgs e)
                { }
                private async void navigationHelper_SaveState(object sender, LoadStateEventArgs e)
                { }
            </code>
            
            2) Register the page to call into the NavigationHelper whenever the page participates 
                in navigation by overriding the <see cref="M:Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Page.OnNavigatedTo(Windows.UI.Xaml.Navigation.NavigationEventArgs)" /> 
                and <see cref="M:Windows.UI.Xaml.Controls.Page.OnNavigatedFrom(Windows.UI.Xaml.Navigation.NavigationEventArgs)" /> events.
            <code>
                protected override void OnNavigatedTo(NavigationEventArgs e)
                {
                    navigationHelper.OnNavigatedTo(e);
                }
                
                protected override void OnNavigatedFrom(NavigationEventArgs e)
                {
                    navigationHelper.OnNavigatedFrom(e);
